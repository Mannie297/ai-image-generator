# Advanced Features Guide

This document provides detailed information about the advanced features of the AI Image Generator.

## Image Generation Settings

### Image Size
- **512x512**: Standard size, good for quick generation and testing
- **768x768**: Balanced size, good for most use cases
- **1024x1024**: High resolution, best for detailed artwork

### Guidance Scale
The guidance scale controls how closely the generated image follows the prompt:
- **5.0-7.0**: More creative, less strict to prompt
- **7.0-10.0**: Balanced approach (recommended)
- **10.0-20.0**: Strict adherence to prompt

### Number of Steps
Controls the number of denoising steps:
- **20-30**: Quick generation, lower quality
- **30-50**: Balanced quality and speed
- **50-100**: Highest quality, slower generation

## Style Presets

### Photographic
Best for realistic images:
- Uses professional photography terms
- Emphasizes camera settings and lighting
- Good for portraits and landscapes

### Digital Art
Ideal for concept art and illustrations:
- Emphasizes digital painting techniques
- Good for fantasy and sci-fi scenes
- Works well with vibrant colors

### Oil Painting
Perfect for classical art style:
- Emphasizes brush strokes and texture
- Good for portraits and still life
- Creates rich, textured images

### Watercolor
Best for soft, artistic images:
- Creates delicate, flowing effects
- Good for landscapes and nature scenes
- Produces soft edges and gentle colors

### Anime
Ideal for anime/manga style:
- Emphasizes cel shading and vibrant colors
- Good for character art
- Creates sharp, clean lines

## Prompt Engineering

### Basic Structure
A good prompt typically follows this structure:
```
[Subject], [Description], [Style], [Quality], [Lighting]
```

Example:
```
A majestic dragon, covered in shimmering scales, digital art, highly detailed, dramatic lighting
```

### Advanced Techniques

#### Weighting
Use parentheses to emphasize certain aspects:
```
A (majestic) dragon, (covered in shimmering scales), digital art, highly detailed
```

#### Blending Styles
Combine multiple styles for unique results:
```
A futuristic cityscape, blending cyberpunk and watercolor styles, highly detailed
```

#### Negative Prompts
Use negative prompts to avoid common issues:
```
blurry, low quality, distorted, bad anatomy, bad proportions
```

## Performance Optimization

### GPU vs CPU
- **GPU**: Recommended for faster generation
  - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
  - At least 8GB VRAM recommended
  - Much faster generation times

- **CPU**: Works but slower
  - Multi-core processor recommended
  - At least 16GB RAM recommended
  - Generation times can be 5-10x slower

### Memory Management
- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Use smaller image sizes if experiencing memory issues
- Consider using CPU if GPU memory is limited

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of Memory Error**
   - Try smaller image size
   - Close other applications
   - Use CPU instead of GPU

2. **Poor Quality Results**
   - Increase number of steps
   - Adjust guidance scale
   - Refine your prompt

3. **Slow Generation**
   - Reduce image size
   - Decrease number of steps
   - Check GPU utilization

### Best Practices

1. **Save Your Prompts**
   - Keep a record of successful prompts
   - Note the settings used
   - Build a prompt library

2. **Experiment**
   - Try different combinations
   - Test various settings
   - Learn from results

3. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with basic prompt
   - Add details gradually
   - Fine-tune settings
